[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_service.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_service", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_service"
  with any of the following names:

    custom_serviceConfig.cmake
    custom_service-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_service" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "custom_service_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "custom_service" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
